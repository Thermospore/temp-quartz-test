Cossack hub is known for having glitchy walls where you can [[OoB]]. [[TheCrypticJacknife]] uploaded [this](https://youtu.be/d5pRPYWzC94) YouTube video in 2011-01-26 demonstrating an OoB near [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]]. There is an unusual OoB by [[2-B2 Lava Lamp Larry|Larry]]'s tree ([[cossack_oob.mp4|video]]) where you can get stuck in a hole underground, and it's difficult to get out.

[[Pasted image 20240930124419.png|This]] ledge can be used to stomp directly up to the [[2-3 It's Just Snowball Madness!|Snowball]] / [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]] area. On [[PS1]] ([[Pasted image 20240930124253.png|geometry]]) it is a little tricky to do < is it? >, but on [[PC]] ([[Pasted image 20240930124012.png|geometry]]) it is quite easy due to the change in [[Quad triangulation]]

The snowman minigame items do not spawn until you talk to the [[Gobbo]]. If you die during the collectathon, your progress is reset and you have to talk to the Gobbo again to re-spawn the items. This happens even if you collect all the items, but haven't talked to the Gobbo to collect the 100 [[Crystal]]s yet. (so shenanigans like in [[Caveman Hub]] don't seem possible)
