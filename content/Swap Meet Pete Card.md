I forget, does it even actually do anything? Do you actually need it? Usually you get it right at the start of the game, but you can skip getting it by immediately using the [[Cheat Mode|Cheat Menu]] to go to a different village

oo well you can't get the crystals from [[Caveman Hub]] minigame without getting the card first (well, if you try and collect them while having 0 [[Crystal]]s, at least). may apply to other minigames

hol up... did it change from blue on [[PS1]] to purple on [[PC]]? (verify)
