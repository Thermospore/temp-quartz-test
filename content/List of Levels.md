(putting this here for now since there isn't a note for cossack / cossack hub yet: Cossack hub is known for having glitchy walls where you can OoB. [[TheCrypticJacknife]] uploaded [this](https://youtu.be/d5pRPYWzC94) YouTube video in 2011-01-26 demonstrating an OoB near [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]]. There is an unusual OoB by [[2-B2 Lava Lamp Larry|Larry]]'s tree ([[cossack_oob.mp4|video]]) where you can get stuck in a hole underground, and it's difficult to get out.)

I got this started by just lazily copying and pasting from [the SRC IL leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/levels)

IDK where the level names came from; PS1? should check for errors / consistency

not sure how to best organize the notes for the levels yet. we could do some combo of:
- organizing them into a folder structure (currently the `.md` file for each level is just sitting in the root folder)
- MOC (map of content)
	- the note you are currently reading, with a list of every single level
	- a note for each hub world, listing all the levels in it?

still need [[Lost Levels|Secret]], the hub maps, also [[Swap Meet Pete|SMP]]? what about all the other `.wad` files?
