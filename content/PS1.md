Checking backlinks will probably reveal some platform / region differences

Could using / not using a save card save time? Also, I wonder if you could save on load times by pre-loading some stuff before starting your run?
# US
Same as with [[PC]], this version has product placement [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]]s, while the others have Jelly Jumps
# EU
The PAL version runs in slow motion at 25 FPS, making it useless for speedruns (NTSC runs at 30 FPS)
# JP
In the JP version you have 5 lives, while only 3 in US/EU. This makes the JP version the preferred version for speedruns. (any other reasons? loading speeds?)
