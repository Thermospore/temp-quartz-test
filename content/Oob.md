[[limbus]] was able to get an OoB on [[Pasted image 20240930120703.png|this]] geometry at the end of [[1-G Sailor Tribe - Secret Mine|Sailor Jigsaw]], on the seam between the door and the wall. but they weren't recording and no one has gotten it since ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1289969765481447454), which has some description on how they got it). If there are other instances of that geometry, it probably works there too
