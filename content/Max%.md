[[Paulmall]] originally came up with the category and initially named it Completionist%. [[Hypnoshark]] then renamed it to Max% ([source](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1284559770480545995)). There are also Max% categories in other games [[Hypnoshark]] is involved with, such as [Crash Nitro Kart](https://www.speedrun.com/cnk?h=Max&x=xd1g034d), [Crash Team Racing](https://www.speedrun.com/ctr), and Spyro.
