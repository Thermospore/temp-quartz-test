Currently when you collect a Jigsaw Piece you are automatically warped out of the [[Secret Level]]

There is speculation ([link](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1282159626900471870)) that this didn't used to be the case, and you used to have to exit the level through other means, such as a [[Door]] or [[Swap Meet Pete Gong]]
- in [[1-G Sailor Tribe - Secret Mine|Sailor Jigsaw]] the level wraps back around and you collect the Jigsaw Piece by the entrance
- in [[3-G Caveman Tribe - Secret Mine|Caveman Jigsaw]] there is a trick [[Swap Meet Pete Gong]] before the Jigsaw Piece, which you presumably had to go back and hit
- in [[4-G Inca Tribe - Secret Maze|Inca Jigsaw]] in the room with the Jigsaw Piece, behind one of the walls there are remnants of a door
