There is no windowed option, but you can achieve this with something like [[DXWnd]] or [[D3DWindower]] (with mixed results)

if you set the resolution to widescreen, the game becomes visibly stretched

(what is the internal aspect ratio? 4:3? ooooo bit of info in "Performance Guidelines" in `readme.txt`)

There are fixes for this (banned in runs?)
- There is a fix on [the PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Croc_2) page (which I haven't tried or looked at)
- I vaguely recall [[hdc0]] making an exe patch or something
