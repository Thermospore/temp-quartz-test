Yeah, doors. There is actually a surprising amount of door tech.

buffering a stomp or a [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]] (see: [[Gummi Buffer]]) through doors

jumping out of movement locks after leaving a door (I guess that isn't exclusive to doors; you can also do this when coming out of the [[Golden Gobbo]] zone in [[2-5 KaBoom! It's Roger Red Ant|Roger]], for example)

clipping through doors, like in [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]] or [[3-3 Race Day at Goldrock|Kart]] (wait didn't [[Paulmall]] clip into [[1-B1 Soveena the Squid|Soveena]]?)

[this](https://youtu.be/tA8IpnChorw) minor door tech where you will come out on a different side depending on which way you are facing when you jump in

wait we also gotta define types of doors:
- doors that warp you within a map (ex: the door you enter after [[Cage Skip]] in [[1-1 Find the Key! Save the Gobbo!|Cage]])
- doors that warp you to a new map (ex: the door in Sailor Hub that takes you to [[1-1 Find the Key! Save the Gobbo!|Cage]], or believe it or not the door in [[1-B1 Soveena the Squid|Soveena]] that takes you into the boss area)
- doors that are just doors (ex: the door that locks you out of [[3-B2 The Village Masher|Masher]])

***waaaaait*** shoot we should separate:
- doors like the physical object / model
- loading zones (which are often behind doors)

so yeah this whole note needs to be re-framed / re-written but yeah
