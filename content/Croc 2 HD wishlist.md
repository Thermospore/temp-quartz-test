hdc0's suggestions:
1. Add back the music tracks that were removed from the PC version due to the CD-ROM size limit
2. Store used boss warps in the savegame
3. Zero the memory pools at level start or initialize the position of the pet platform
4. Fix the translation to other languages

[[Limbus]] suggestions:
Quality of Life Suggestions:
1. Keep glitches in the game if they're useful for speedrunning and they're not going to infringe on a normal player's experience of the game. Some great examples of this are [[Upwarp|upwarps]], [[Cutscene Break|binocular skipping/cutscene breaks]] and [[Hazard Jump|hazard jumping]].
2. If Croc 2 HD has to feature Jelly Jumps rather than Gummi Savers for copyright reasons, keep the bigger Gummi Saver hitbox on the new Jellies, they're much easier to land on and they make the jumps more forgiving.
3. Add a collectible item that's automatically obtained upon collecting 100 crystals in a level, perhaps a Crystal Gobbo like the Golden Gobbo. These could be tracked against the save file, and could appear outside the level entrance alongside the Golden Gobbo.
4. Add level names to the pause menu, or have them appear as a text overlay when approaching a level door. They only appeared in the PlayStation version on load screens, and not at all in the PC version.
5. Improve the Minecart Jump mechanic. Currently, jumping while the minecart is going up an incline will give you almost no height, making some Crystals impossible to collect on the first run through a section.
6. Improve the throwing mechanic. This is most relevant to [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!]] due to the tendency for the babies to land outside the playpens when they shouldn't.
7. Currently, when the Golden Gobbo has been collected for a level, when you go back into that level the Colour Crystals are gone and the Golden Gobbo becomes inaccessible. This also makes it impossible to collect 100 Crystals in [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower]] if you haven't already, because there are 10 crystals in the Golden Gobbo room. It would be better if they simply spawn like usual.
8. Alongside any other graphical enhancement options, have an option to choose between Croc's more polygonal PlayStation model, or the smoother one from the PC version.

Larger Changes (if the aim is a very faithful remaster that changes little about the structure of the game, these might be outside the scope of the project):
1. For the sake of verisimilitude and adding a bit of extra content, Colour Crystals and a Golden Gobbo room should be added to [[4-3 Bride of the Dungeon of Defright]] and [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower]], and increase the Golden Gobbo requirement for entering [[4-G Inca Tribe - Secret Maze]] from 2 to 4.
2. Rather than having a Marathon of the last 2 bosses and 2 levels in the Inca Village, it would be nice to have a secondary hub area behind the main temple door with entrances to [[4-3 Bride of the Dungeon of Defright]] and [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower]] so they can be played in any order like the rest of the game, along with a door specifically for replaying [[4-B2 Dante's Final Fight]]. The plane could be added to the main Inca Village after completing [[4-B1 Dante's Peak]] as a way to replay that level.
3. Cut early levels as bonus content, perhaps in a more finished state if it's feasible, but even in an unfinished but playable state they'd be interesting as historical curios. These could include:
  - Raft Race: While this appears to have conceptually evolved into the Boat Race, the actual level appeared to be very different and featured some unique enemies.
  - Snowboarding: This one is only known about due to datamining of the Croc 2 PSX demo by [[OverSurge]]. Not to be confused with the snowboarding level that was cut from Croc 1.
  - Swimming Levels: At least two are known about, the one with the giant fish monster seen in [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCtowzjpmaY), and one that was datamined by [[OverSurge]].
  - The original outdoor Cannon Boat Keith fight
  - The Plane Level: while according to [[Nic Cusworth]], this level was retooled into [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley]] due to the low draw distance forcing the plane to move slowly, this would obviously no longer be an issue on modern hardware, and from the 1 second we've ever seen of it, the level appeared to have been different enough in layout to justify being separate to [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley]].

Glitches to be fixed:
1. [[Invisible wall|Invisible walls]]. Sometimes when jumping across the threshold of a ledge over the void, Croc's horizontal speed will be reduced suddenly to zero, which can often lead to death. They seem to be caused by Croc's position being directly above the void, and they're exacerbated by the presence of Ice and Conveyor Belts.
2. When using TNT to break the first Box containing a Wheel on [[3-2 Find the Wheels in the Mine!]], if the Box is moving between Conveyor belts when the second TNT hits, the wheel will spawn far below where the box was. It seems to look for the floor directly beneath where the box was to spawn it, and if there's no floor, it goes to 0.
3. Rings of 8 Crystals such as the ones that appear in [[2-2 Chase the Choo Choo Train]] and [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower]] will disappear if the player dies, only respawning upon Game Over or re-entering the level.
