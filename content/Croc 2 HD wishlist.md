[[Limbus]] suggestions:
1. Keep glitches in the game if they're cool, they make speedruns fun and they're not going to infringe on a normal player's experiences of the game. Some great examples of this are [[Upwarp|upwarps]], [[Cutscene Break|binocular skipping/cutscene breaks]] and [[Hazard Jump|hazard jumping]].
2. If Croc 2 HD has to feature Jelly Jumps rather than Gummi Savers for copyright reasons, keep the bigger Gummi Saver hitbox on the new Jellies, they're much easier to land on and they make the jumps more forgiving.
3. Add a collectible item that's automatically obtained upon collecting 100 crystals in a level, perhaps a Crystal Gobbo like the Golden Gobbo. These could be tracked against the save file, and could appear outside the level entrance like Golden Gobbos do.

Glitches to be fixed:
1. [[Invisible wall|Invisible walls]]. Sometimes when jumping across the threshold of a ledge over the void, Croc's horizontal speed will be reduced suddenly to zero, which can often lead to death. They seem to be caused by Croc's position being directly above the void, and they're exacerbated by the presence of Ice and Conveyor Belts.
2. When using TNT to break the first Box containing a Wheel on [[3-2 Find the Wheels in the Mine!]], if the Box is moving between Conveyor belts when the second TNT hits, the wheel will spawn far below where the box was. It seems to look for the floor directly beneath where the box was to spawn it, and if there's no floor, it goes to 0.
3. Rings of 8 Crystals such as the ones that appear in [[2-2 Chase the Choo Choo Train]] and [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower]] will disappear if the player dies, only respawning upon Game Over or re-entering the level.
