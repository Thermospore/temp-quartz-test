This screen can be accessed via the [[Options]] in the [[Main Menu]], or in-game via the [[Pause Menu]]

Trying to access it via the [[Pause Menu]] will hard crash the game in the following levels:
- [[2-3 It's Just Snowball Madness!|Snowball]]
- [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]] (as does the [[Lost Levels|Secret]] version)
- [[4-B1 Dante's Peak|Plane]]
- [[Lost Levels|Secret]] Cossack hub (still need to make a note for the hubs haha)
- (any others??)
