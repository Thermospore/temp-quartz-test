# Define Controls
This screen can be accessed in two ways:
1. via the [[Options]] in the [[Main Menu]]
2. in-game via the [[Pause Menu]]

Unfortunately, even if you re-map the *Movement* keys the mappings only apply in-game; in the [[Main Menu]] you must still use the arrow keys

## Japanese language crash
When the system language is set to Japanese, the Define Controls menu is buggy and accessing it can cause the game to hard crash

[Here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1292210678022672466) is some discussion between [[hdc0]] and [[Thermospore]] troubleshooting the issue
### Keyboard arrow Keys
Mapping an [[Pasted image 20241006134720.png|arrow key]] makes all text for that mapping go blank. For example in [[Pasted image 20241006100658.png|this]] screenshot, one of the *Movement* keys has been mapped to an arrow key

In this state, trying to access the Define Controls screen via the [[Pause Menu]] will hard crash the game in the following levels:
- [[Lost Levels|Secret]] [[1-1 Find the Key! Save the Gobbo!|Cage]] ([clip](https://www.twitch.tv/thermospore/clip/BoxySaltySrirachaTheTarFu-27Qp22DcufbY6fNb))
- [[Cossack Village]] (as does the [[Lost Levels|Secret]] version)
- [[2-3 It's Just Snowball Madness!|Snowball]]
- [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]] (as does the [[Lost Levels|Secret]] version)
- [[4-B1 Dante's Peak|Plane]]
- (and probably many others)
  
It is confirmed to not crash in [[Sailor Village]] ([[Pasted image 20241006133352.png|screenshot]])
### Controller analog stick
- The analog stick is also blank in the [[Main Menu]] ([[Pasted image 20241006140649.png|screenshot]])
- In some levels (ex [[Sailor Village]] or [[Cossack Village]]) it does not hard crash in the [[Pause Menu]], but has a messed up name ([[Pasted image 20241006142425.png|screenshot]])
- In [[2-3 It's Just Snowball Madness!|Snowball]] you can open the Define Controls screen to the Keyboard page ([[Pasted image 20241006141307.png|screenshot]]), but if you try to move over to the controller page the game hard crashes

# Control Method
This setting can only be accessed in-game via the [[Pause Menu]] (?)

(maybe quote the manual, because it has a better explanations lol)
## Type 1
Type 1 is modern controls, where Croc's movement is relative to the camera direction
## Type 2
Type 2 is classic tank controls, where Croc's movement is entirely independent from the camera. This makes movement very consistent, and is useful for setups (ex [[Jiggy Clip]] or [[Hella Skip]]). Unfortunately, Type 2 doesn't seem to be available on [[PS1|PSX]], only [[PC]]
