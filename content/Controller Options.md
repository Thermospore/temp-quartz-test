# Control Method (Type 1/2)
Type 1 is modern controls, where Croc's movement is relative to the camera direction

Type 2 is classic tank controls, where Croc's movement is entirely independent from the camera. This makes movement very consistent, and is useful for setups (ex [[Jiggy Clip]] or [[Hella Skip]]). Unfortunately, Type 2 doesn't seem to be available on [[PS1|PSX]], only [[PC]]
