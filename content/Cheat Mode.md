  - Cheat Menu

We almost always refer to this as the "Cheat Menu", for whatever reason

There is a nice section [here](https://tcrf.net/Croc_2_(Windows,_PlayStation)#Cheat_Mode) on TCRF about it, but here are the codes for both [[PS1]] and [[PC]], for convenience:

> For PlayStation, at the title screen, hold **L1** and press **Triangle, Left, Left, Right, Square, Up, Up, Left, Circle**. If entered correctly, 'Cheat Menu Active' will appear at the top of the screen. During gameplay, press **R2 + L2** simultaneously to bring up the cheat menu.
> 
> For Windows, at the title screen, hold **A** and then press **T, Left, Left, Right, Space, Up, Up, Left, C**. During gameplay, press **Page Up and Page Down** simultaneously.

NOTE: it works on JP [[PS1]] too; you just have to use ✕ instead of ○

[[hdc0]] figured out how to activate this on [[PC]], along with a bunch of other [[Cheats]], in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/forums/l2qjp) classic SRC post

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0B_O-F742E) is a clip where [[Thermospore]] managed to bug it out and have it open in the [[Main Menu]]

[[limbus]] noticed that in an old April 1999 build of the game, Cheat Mode had additional options that are not present in the release version of the game. For example, there is a full "Level Select" as well as a "Set Level Complete" option ([discord post](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1285548575350325309))
- and [[hdc0]] [points out](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1286181586127294514) that version of the Cheat Menu is present in [this PC demo](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Croc_2_(Windows,_PlayStation)/PC_Demo#Cheats)
- is that level select functionally the same as [this](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1286305863924973578) one in the final game?

# Select Hub
You can select 1 through 5. You spawn into the hub as if you walked out of [[Swap Meet Pete|SMP]] (double check this; there are multiple hub spawns)

# Inventory Edit
Here are the maximum values you are allowed to give yourself in the Inventory Edit screen:

(though, as seen in [[Key]], it is possible for the values to go higher than that)
