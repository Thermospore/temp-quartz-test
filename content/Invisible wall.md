Unfortunately a common bug in this game is to hit an "invisible wall" and lose some or all of your momentum, which can result in you falling to your death.

[[OrionYTP]] found a crazy one in [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]] ([video](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1298333362783649866))

[[Conveyor belt]]s and [[Ice]] also could be complicating factors
