on entry: hold ⬈ then immediately switch to ⬆

wait wasn't there some sort of crazy skip right at the entrance? like you jump over the wall and skip into some section?

near the entrance, you can do a [[Gummi Buffer]] into the [[Golden Gobbo]] room and make it to the first platform [[waterfall_gg_gummi_buffer.mp4|like so]]

you can skip up the waterfall [[Pasted image 20240621223327.png|here]] from the bridge by frontflipping into it

it is *possible* to front flip up [[Pasted image 20240622174313.png|this]] wall at the start, saving a [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]], but it is quite hard and we can just do an [[Upwarp]] now

[[Pasted image 20240621220022.png|this]] box is sus; sometimes you can just fall through the ground when stomping it (to fall through the ground, do you have to hold the stomp all the way through, such that you stomp on the ground as well?)

some [[Upwarp]]s here, such as [[Pasted image 20240621220614.png|this one]], you can fall through the ground if you aren't careful

what's up with the cycle for the last [[Rope]] in the [[Golden Gobbo]] room again, can you make it? maybe had something to do with the rope only being active when you are within a certain range 

For [[Max%]] there might be a crazy route utilizing [[Upwarp]]s / [[Save Gong]]s / that skip at the entrance... (look into this later)

[here](https://youtu.be/0QLApkMw2SE) is a crazy [[100%|hundo]] route by [[Paulmall]] for inspiration, which was originally posted [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/742347416899944569) (currently in [[100%]] we just do the [[Any%]] route for waterfall)
