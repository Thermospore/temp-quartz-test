[[Pasted image 20240621220022.png|this]] box is sus; sometimes you can just fall through the ground when stomping it (to fall through the ground, do you have to hold the stomp all the way through, such that you stomp on the ground as well?)

some [[Upwarp]]s here, such as [[Pasted image 20240621220614.png|this one]], you can fall through the ground if you aren't careful

you can skip up the waterfall here from the bridge by frontflipping into it
