This level seems to have some interesting cursed geometry, as pointed out by [[limbus]] [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283237887714000926) (disclamers: these are models extracted from PS1, not PC. and it could be possible the weird seams come from the manner in which the models were extracted?)
