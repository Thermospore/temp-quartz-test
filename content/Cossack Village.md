Cossack hub is known for having glitchy walls where you can [[Oob]]. [[TheCrypticJacknife]] uploaded [this](https://youtu.be/d5pRPYWzC94) YouTube video in 2011-01-26 demonstrating an OoB near [[2-4 Hang Glider Valley|Glider]]. There is an unusual OoB by [[2-B2 Lava Lamp Larry|Larry]]'s tree ([[cossack_oob.mp4|video]]) where you can get stuck in a hole underground, and it's difficult to get out.
