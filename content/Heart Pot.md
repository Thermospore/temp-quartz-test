On [[PS1]] you start with only 3, except for [[PS1#JP]] where you start with 5. You start with 5 in both regions on [[PC]]

You can obtain more:
- the minigame in [[Sailor Hub]]
- the [[Clockwork Gobbo]] in [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Theif]]
- buying them from [[Swap Meet Pete|SMP]]
- [[Cheat Mode|Cheat Menu]]
- (pretty sure that's it, apart from like [[Cheat Engine]])
