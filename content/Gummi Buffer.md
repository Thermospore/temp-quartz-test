get a link to where this was initially found on discord (through [[Door]] in last room of [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Sandwich]])

it works through
- [[Door]]s (that article needs to be re-worked btw)
- [[Golden Gobbo]] warps
- [[Climbing Wall]]s (maybe ladders too?)
- maybe more

It does not seem to work through
- Ledge Grab
- [[Minecart]]s (... double check though)
- Hippo Jump
- [[Clockwork Gobbo]] - barely!!
	- if you enter a Clockwork Gobbo level and manually set a purple [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] with [[Cheat Engine]], you do a Gummi Buffer on exit!
	- by doing a [[Hazard Jump]] when landing on the Clockwork Marker, you can enter with the [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] values maintained!
	- you would think all the pieces are in place for the Gummi Buffer to work, however the buffer fails when exiting the Clockwork Gobbo for some reason :snowsad: ...  possibly due to the way the game re-situates croc back on the ground due to entering with a [[Hazard Jump]]?

actually, this might be part of a larger type of buffer, where certain actions (such as stomp jumps) are buffered through [[Door]]s etc
