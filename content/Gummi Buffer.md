get a link to where this was initially found on discord (through [[Door]] in last room of [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Sandwich]])

it works through
- [[Door]]s (that article needs to be re-worked btw)
- [[Golden Gobbo]] warps
- [[Climbing Wall]]s (maybe ladders too?)
- maybe more (ledge grab???)

actually, this might be part of a larger type of buffer, where certain actions (such as stomp jumps) are buffered through [[Door]]s etc
