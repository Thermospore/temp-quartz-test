You don't have to be on the ground to use a Clockwork Gobbo. You can even use it in the air, as long as:
1. you are above the clockwork marker
2. there is nothing between Croc and the clockwork marker
	- for example, [[Pasted image 20241019162537.png|this]] bridge in [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]] blocks Clockwork Gobbo usage (you can [[crow_balloonlessRG.mp4|jump around it though!]])
	- < any levels other than [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]] where we can check / verify this? >

There are some clockwork gobbo areas you can get into as Croc, without using cheats
- [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]]
- [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]]

(can you collect the [[Color Crystal|Gem]]/[[Crystal]]s as Croc, tho?)
# Position memory address
Even when doing a Clockwork Gobbo, the game still uses the same XYZ coordinate addresses that Croc uses (presumably, a Clockwork Gobbo is still internally "Croc", but with a different model and some abilities disabled?)

You can use [[Cheat Engine]] to edit the XYZ addresses to warp yourself out of the Clockwork Gobbo area and roll around the normal level, which is kinda funny
