You don't have to be on the ground to use a Clockwork Gobbo. You can even use it in the air, as long as you are above the clockwork marker < WAIT investigate if you can activate the [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]] one up from the bridge!!!!! >

There are some clockwork gobbo areas you can get into as Croc, without using cheats
- [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]]
- [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]]

(can you collect the [[Color Crystal|Gem]]/[[Crystal]]s as Croc, tho?)
# Position memory address
Even when doing a Clockwork Gobbo, the game still uses the same XYZ coordinate addresses that Croc uses (presumably, a Clockwork Gobbo is still internally "Croc", but with a different model and some abilities disabled?)

You can use [[Cheat Engine]] to edit the XYZ addresses to warp yourself out of the Clockwork Gobbo area and roll around the normal level, which is kinda funny
