There are some clockwork gobbo areas you can get into as Croc, without using cheats
- [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]]
- [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]]

(can you collect the [[Color Crystal|Gem]]/[[Crystal]]s as Croc, tho?)
# Position memory address
Even when doing a Clockwork Gobbo, the game still uses the same XYZ coordinate addresses that Croc uses (presumably, a Clockwork Gobbo is still internally "Croc", but with a different model and some abilities disabled?)

You can use [[Cheat Engine]] to edit the XYZ addresses to warp yourself out of the Clockwork Gobbo area and roll around the normal level, which is kinda funny
