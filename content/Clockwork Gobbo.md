Even when doing a Clockwork Gobbo, the game still uses the same XYZ coordinate addresses that Croc uses (presumably, a Clockwork Gobbo is still internally "Croc", but with a different model and some abilities disabled?)

You can use [[Cheat Engine]] to edit the XYZ addresses to warp yourself out of the Clockwork Gobbo area and roll around the normal level, which is kinda funny
