You can [[OoB]] on the welcome door lmao [link](https://youtu.be/Qis5U9ihdd8&t=158)

The layout of the entrance area is different between [[PC]] and [[PS1]] (did [[Nic Cusworth]] confirm (maybe in [this](https://youtu.be/Ud2UW0B3NNk?si=IoMQq5T5qcX1Bo-b) video?) if this was due to render distance limitations on PSX?)

# Minigames
## Simon Says
Gives you 1 [[Heart Pot]]

Once you start talking to the [[Gobbo]], you can actually immediately quit out of the dialogue and do the JUMP → TAIL ATTACK → STOMP at your own pace ([[2024-10-17 18-57-34.mp4|video]]). You must land the jump before doing the tail attack. You'll know you did it right when you get the poof of leaves

Fun fact: if you can somehow make it up to the top of the tree (ex using [[Cheat Engine]]), you are able to collect the [[Heart Pot]] without talking to the [[Gobbo]]!
## Trampoline
Gives you 100 [[Crystal]]s
# Sailor River
The river carries you at 64 units per frame in the +X direction

It is possible to jump out of the river directly onto the [[1-B1 Soveena the Squid|Soveena]] side of the bank

	- this seems more consistent / repeatable
