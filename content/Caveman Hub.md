It is possible to stomp directly up from [[Swap Meet Pete|SMP]] to the lava river, without taking the ramp (ADD A VIDEO OF IT). [[Thermospore]] calculated it saves about 0.4 seconds ([google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hxLD4lTYKMre238Lb4G2PMxfm8mAmUd7WmKIgy8Y898/edit?usp=sharing))

In addition to making it rain, the witch doctor [[Gobbo]] can make it snow! You just might have to talk to him many many times... ([discord](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1287259842326827171))
