Checking backlinks will probably reveal some platform / region differences
# Regions
## US
Same as with [[PS1]], this version has product placement [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]]s, while the others have plain Jelly Jumps. This seems to provide an advantage, because the Gummi Jumps are wider. This, for example, allows you to make a jump in [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Theif]] / [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Sandwich]] with only a Blue, instead of the intended Green.
## EU
This version has multiple European languages available, while the US version only has English
# Installing multiple regions simultaneously
You can have multiple regions installed simultaneously, as long as they are installed in separate folders

However, you should make sure to set the EU version's language back to English before running the US version, or [[Pasted image 20240930183556.png|funky stuff happens]] ([source](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1287406437743722630)). Apparently there are [some commands](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1287413605343432825) you can run to fix this

If you mix and match [[Croc2.exe]] and `.wad` files between US and EU you can get strange effects, such as giant [[Jelly Jump|Jelly Jump]]s or tiny Gummi Jumps lol ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1256962341665374269))
