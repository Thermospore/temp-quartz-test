For some reason on PC, quads seem to be triangulated in the opposite direction from [[PS1]]. This appears to be the reason why things such as [[Cage Skip]], [[Upwarp]]s, [[Pasted image 20240930123736.png|this]] ledge in [[Cossack Village]], etc work differently between PS1 and PC (found by [[limbus]] [2024-09-30](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290108572511764584))

(add some example images. also should make this its own subsection (in the PC article? or in its own dedicated note?), so we can just link to this from other articles, instead of having to explain "quad triangulation" every time it comes up lol)
