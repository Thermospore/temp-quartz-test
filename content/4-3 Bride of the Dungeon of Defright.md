By utilizing a [[Cutscene Break]] you can exit the level early, before the game has finished giving you all of your [[Crystal]]s. For example, if you exit when your Crystal count has only reached 99/100, the 99 will be added to your [[Swap Meet Pete Card|SMP Card]], then you will enter [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower]] with 1/100 Crystals. You can then complete [[4-4 Goo Man Chu's Tower|Tower]] with 101/100 Crystals, so you are still able to collect all 100 crystals in each level.
