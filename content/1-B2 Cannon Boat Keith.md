It is possible to [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] into the boss room ([video](https://youtu.be/wDYtGKekBl4&t=42)). The timing seems to be approximately when you pass [[Pasted image 20240919194119.png|the threshold]] into the room

Doing the cannons from right to left is probably advantageous
- due to the tunnel structure, you enter the boss room slightly on the right side
- there isn't a post in your way when going to the middle cannon

You can't stomp the cannons, you must tail attack them

You can [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] after each cannon hit ([video](https://youtu.be/wDYtGKekBl4&t=49)). You have to tail attack early to get it

You can make it to the right / left cannons with a front flip (discovered [2021-01-08](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/797023111509573642) by [[Thermospore]]). There is a simple setup: just line up between the [[Pasted image 20240919195959.png|2nd and 3rd boards]]. Landing directly on the boardwalk is slightly tight, but you have more leeway if you land on the big post in front of the cannon. Apparently, "even with a brief stop to line up, a front flip is ~.35 faster!" ([[Thermospore|thermo]] wrote this in [the Any% route spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cddsP_i7G51BK8NbYgq3ZAQfI5HPkYhyCTCz47lGURo/edit?gid=863620694#gid=863620694)). The catch is, this prevents you from doing the [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] on the cannon, because you can't tail attack until you land.

Probably the optimal strat ([demonstration](https://youtu.be/XKoU4jYjFtE&t=64)) is:
1. don't front flip on the first cannon, so you can [[Cutscene Break|CSB]]
2. [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] on the middle cannon (there is no front flip strat for the middle cannon)
3. front flip to the 3rd cannon, because you don't have to [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] after
