There is ice present in levels such as:
- [[Cossack Village]]
- [[2-2 Chase the Choo Choo Train|Train]]
- (wait.... is that literally it lol?)

Also, it is widely speculated that the top of the cribs in [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]] are actually ice

< do you actually go faster on ice? needs confirmation >
