You do not appear to move faster on ice (need to verify this using an objective way to measure speed, but it appears so from this [[2024-10-06 20-40-05.mkv|clip]]). However, you do gain a bunch of inertia

There is ice present in levels such as:
- [[Cossack Hub]]
- [[2-2 Chase the Choo Choo Train|Train]]
- (wait.... is that literally it lol?)

Also, it is speculated that the top of the cribs in [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]] are actually ice
