Add stuff here about [[hdc0]] exe patches (mouse, [[2-1 Save the Ice Trapped Gobbos!|Iceblock]] music, widescreen, etc?)

Oooo maybe we should have like an MoC for all the files in the game directory (wads, exe, loading bmp, etc)

There are already some resources covering game files to some extent; check [[External Resources]]
