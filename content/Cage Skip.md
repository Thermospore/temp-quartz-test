It was found in [[1-1 Find the Key! Save the Gobbo!|Cage]], but the geometry is in many levels
- [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Theif]]
- [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]]
- (list others)

There are differences between [[PC]] and [[PS1]], likely due the change in [[Quad triangulation]]
# [[PC]]
## Left side
It's pretty easy to do. Found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0RS7hTrOA4) by [[-o-]], then posted [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/419523187064438784) on Discord by [[hdc0]]

Apparently you can do it down at the bottom too... ([clip](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/476594364106276870/729585297901486110))
## Right side
It is quite hard, and probably requires either luck or a setup. Found by [[Cheftoad]] [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/448107691496439809)

[[croc 2 pc right cage skip.mov|Here]] is another clip of [[Thermospore]] getting it

(isn't there another pattern where you are facing diagonally towards the [[Door]] / [[Color Crystal|Gem]]?)
# [[PS1]]
## Left side
When was this first found? It is in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQamI1Zl0P4&t=35s) [[Hypnoshark]] run (on [[PS1#JP]]), at least

([[Paulmall]] said ([1](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290133155160002611) , [2](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290159088654618775)) on [[PS1]] it might be easier on JP than US/EU, but this is very unconfirmed)
## Right side
[Here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290133147069055062) is a clip of [[limbus]] getting it, during the [[Quad triangulation]] saga.

When was this first found? Is it the same as right side on PC? I mean there is probably *some* difference due to the [[Quad triangulation]] change
