It was found in [[1-1 Find the Key! Save the Gobbo!|Cage]], but the geometry is in many levels
- (list the levels)

There are differences between [[PC]] and [[PS1]], likely due to quads being triangularized in the opposite direction
# [[PC]]
## Left side
Found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0RS7hTrOA4) by [[-o-]], posted [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/419523187064438784) on Discord by [[hdc0]]

Apparently you can do it down at the bottom too... ([clip](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/476594364106276870/729585297901486110))
## Right side
Found by [[Cheftoad]] [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/448107691496439809)
# [[PS1]]
## Left side
When was this first found? It is in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQamI1Zl0P4&t=35s) [[Hypnoshark]] run (on [[PS1#JP]]), at least

([[Paulmall]] said ([1](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290133155160002611) , [2](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290159088654618775)) there might be differences on [[PS1]] between US/EU and JP, but this is very unconfirmed)
## Right side
[Here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290133147069055062) is a clip of [[limbus]] getting it, during the quad triangularization swap discovery saga.

When was this first found? Is it the same as right side on PC? I mean there is probably *some* difference due to the triangularization swap
