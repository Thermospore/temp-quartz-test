this aims to be a one stop shop for Croc 2 speedrunning knowledge

I envision at first it will mostly consist of jotted down notes and links to external resources (YouTube, Discord, Google Docs/Sheets, TCRF) aimed at current runners, but gradually turn into a proper wiki/documentation also accessible to new runners

please feel free to add notes / info!

there are not really any rules atm, just try to write in a way that will make sense to others (or yourself 5 years from now)

the site is simply a pile of text files in markdown format (hosted [here](https://github.com/Thermospore/temp-quartz-test/tree/v4/content) on GitHub). you can edit the files right on the GitHub website, or clone the repo and edit with whatever you like ([[Thermospore]] likes Obsidian)

if you edit the files it will take ~60s for the changes to reflect on the site
