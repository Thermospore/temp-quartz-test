this aims to be a one stop shop for Croc 2 speedrunning knowledge

I envision at first it will mostly consist of jotted down notes and links to external resources (YouTube, Discord, Google Docs/Sheets, TCRF) aimed at current runners, but gradually turn into a proper wiki/documentation also accessible to new runners

please feel free to add notes / info!

there are not really any rules atm, just try to write in a way that will make sense to others (or yourself 5 years from now)

the site is simply a pile of text files in markdown format (hosted [here](https://github.com/Thermospore/temp-quartz-test/tree/v4/content) on GitHub). you can edit the files right on the GitHub website, or clone the repo and edit with whatever you like ([[Thermospore]] likes Obsidian)

if you edit the files it will take ~60s for the changes to reflect on the site
# To-do
## make a note for each level
- how to title them?
	- ps1 titles? i dont remember if there were titles anywhere on pc version
	- probably add colloquial titles (like mines, snowball, fire) as [aliases](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/AliasRedirects)
- how to organize?
	- could make a folder for each world?
	- could just leave all the notes (`.md` files) in root in a big pile, and make a MOC note?
## media folder
we had better get images n stuff into a folder (like `quartz/content/media` or something), or this is gonna become a mess real fast

probably gotta fiddle around with quartz (and obsidian) settings. [this](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/CrawlLinks) might be a lead
## ^[this thing]
I like citing sources with this thing^[url goes here] (like wikipedia style) cos it's very fast and easy. but it seems to not work on quartz - see [[Hella Skip]]. gotta either fix that or find a different way to cite
