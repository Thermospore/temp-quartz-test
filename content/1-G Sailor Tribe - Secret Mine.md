Hold ➚ on entry (I guess more like → for [[Max%]])

If only you could clip into the cage to grab the [[Jigsaw Piece]] early... (many attempts have been made)

This level contains some [[Smash Box#Double stack|double stack Smash Boxes]]

You must break the box to get up to [[Pasted image 20240923205311.png|this]] section (to get the crystals for [[Max%]]), so you only have one shot. But if you mess up, you can re-spawn the box with a [[Death Abuse|DA]]!

It might save time to [[Death Abuse|DA]] on the [[Jigsaw Piece]] so you aren't warped, then walk out?? ([video](https://youtu.be/YquOqQz36uU&t=28m55s))
# Key room DA
Currently when we grab the [[Key]], we backtrack to a lava pit to [[Death Abuse|DA]] back to the entrance to get the [[Jigsaw Piece]]. It would save time if we could DA more quickly, perhaps with an [[OoB]]. In fact [[limbus]] was able to [[OoB]] + [[Death Abuse|DA]] [[Pasted image 20240930120703.png|here]] on the seam between the door and the wall on 2024-09-30, but they weren't recording and no one has gotten it since ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1289969765481447454), which has some description on how they got it)
