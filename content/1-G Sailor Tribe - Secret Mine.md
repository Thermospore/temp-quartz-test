hold ➚ on entry (I guess more like → for [[Max%]])

if only you could clip into the cage to grab the [[Jigsaw Piece]] early... (many attempts have been made)

Currently when we grab the [[Key]], we backtrack to a lava pit to [[Death Abuse|DA]] back to the entrance to get the [[Jigsaw Piece]]. It would save time if we could DA more quickly, perhaps with an [[Oob]]

It might save time to [[Death Abuse|DA]] on the [[Jigsaw Piece]] so you aren't warped, then walk out?? ([video](https://youtu.be/YquOqQz36uU&t=28m55s))
