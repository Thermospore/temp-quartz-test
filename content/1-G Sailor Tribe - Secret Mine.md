hold ➚ on entry (I guess more like → for [[Max%]])

This level contains two stacks of two boxes. The only other level in the game with a stack like this is [[2-2 Chase the Choo Choo Train|Chase the Choo-Choo Train]]. It's possible to break these stacks with a single jump and stomp, instead of jumping on top of the stack, then jumping again to stomp. It's easier to do if Croc's facing direction is adjusted to be perpendicular to his movement direction, so there's no risk of a ledge grab. If done correctly, it's slightly faster.

if only you could clip into the cage to grab the [[Jigsaw Piece]] early... (many attempts have been made)

You must break the box to get up to [[Pasted image 20240923205311.png|this]] section (to get the crystals for [[Max%]]), so you only have one shot. But if you mess up, you can re-spawn the box with a [[Death Abuse|DA]]!

Currently when we grab the [[Key]], we backtrack to a lava pit to [[Death Abuse|DA]] back to the entrance to get the [[Jigsaw Piece]]. It would save time if we could DA more quickly, perhaps with an [[Oob]]

It might save time to [[Death Abuse|DA]] on the [[Jigsaw Piece]] so you aren't warped, then walk out?? ([video](https://youtu.be/YquOqQz36uU&t=28m55s))
