Generally if you are inside of something you shouldn't be, the game will pop you out on top of it ("upwarp" you). This can be abused in several ways.

The most well known / prevalent upwarp is [this](https://youtu.be/IiwgHgq1IGs) one. It was discovered by [[Cheftoad]] on 2018-5-18 in [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]] ([original video](https://clips.twitch.tv/BoringBeautifulScallionUncleNox) & [Discord saga](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/446943289233506315)). [[Thermospore]] made a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/IiwgHgq1IGs) for it. It can be done anywhere that same geometry shows up, for example in:
- [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]]
- [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower!|Pet]]
- [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]]
