Generally if you are inside of something you shouldn't be, the game will pop you out on top of it ("upwarp" you). This can be abused in several ways.

The most well known / prevalent upwarp is [this](https://youtu.be/IiwgHgq1IGs) one. It was discovered by [[Cheftoad]] on 2018-05-18 in [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]] ([original video](https://clips.twitch.tv/BoringBeautifulScallionUncleNox) & [Discord saga](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/446943289233506315)). [[Thermospore]] made a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/IiwgHgq1IGs) for it. It can be done anywhere that same geometry shows up, for example in:
- [[3-1 Find the Wheels in the Jungle!|Jungle]]
- [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower!|Pet]]
- [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]]

(wait, there are some cases where that geometry wont work, right? like if there is no floor above? or like at the end of [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower!|Pet]] where there is a tiki torch above)

Originally we thought it only worked on [[PC]], but [[limbus]] discovered on [2024-09-30](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290114434353860679) that it works on [[PS1]] too ([video](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290116347107213434)). You just have to do it on the opposite side, due to a change in [[Quad triangulation]]

(implement [this](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290150696238321666) info/speculation from [[limbus]] on the requirements for it to work)

There is a tendency for the camera to get stuck after doing an upwarp (particularly in [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]]). Fortunately it is avoidable:

> Yeah the trick is to start moving immediately
> 
> If you let croc upwarp and don't move, the camera won't follow you
> 
> So just start moving immediately after clipping and it almost never gets stuck
