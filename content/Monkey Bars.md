Many occurences seem to be in [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]], but this could simply be because there are many Monkey Bars in the level, not because they are especially cursed.

[[limbus]] [theorizes](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283232257317933166) it could be happening when crossing the seam between modules, similar to how you can get stumbles when running over seams. This needs more investigation, but seems plausible ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283326200395337769))
