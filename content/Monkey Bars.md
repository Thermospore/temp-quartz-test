When falling from above, it is possible (though difficult) to directly grab onto the bottom side of monkey bars (discovered [2018-12-08](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/520880491587436554) by [[Thermospore]])

There are many instances of people randomly dropping off Monkey Bars

Many occurences seem to be in [[1-3 Get the Gobbo's Sandwich!|Crow]], but this could simply be because there are many Monkey Bars in the level, not because they are especially cursed.

[[limbus]] [theorizes](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283232257317933166) it could be happening when crossing the seam between modules, similar to how you can get stumbles when running over seams. This needs more investigation, but seems plausible ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283326200395337769))
