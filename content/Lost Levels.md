We call this "Secret" for whatever reason. Not to be confused with the [[Secret Level]]s
- OH I FOUND THE REASON, I guess they do call it "Secret" in the Load Game screen... ([[Pasted image 20240903200751.png|screenshot]])

You can apparently [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] the egg collecting animation, and weird stuff can happen ([discord post](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1285958479814721578); needs more investigation)

Whatever you do, do NOT jump while grabbing an egg, or [this](https://www.twitch.tv/thermospore/clip/PiercingEndearingSageSuperVinlin-O7k_eDsl1dmAo5P8) will happen
- combining this with a [[Cutscene Break|CSB]] could potentially allow you a lot of time to do shenanigans before the animation finishes and you get warped?
