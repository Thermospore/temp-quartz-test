In [[Any%]], you can kill the thief (does he have a name? the gobbo at the entrance didn't provide one) as early as [here](https://youtu.be/dRv3UE2Tbzw&t=438) (who found this? when/where?)

The thief can also be killed early [here](https://youtu.be/lvpVkMP0zHQ&t=1381)

Believe it or not, you can simply jump [[Pasted image 20240623212115.png|these]] gaps around the huge trees. You can even grind up against the tree a little bit and it's OK.

In [[Pasted image 20240623214340.png|this]] cave, you can get back to the upper section without using a [[Balloon]]. If you jump inside a crate as it spawns, you will [[Upwarp]] on top ([[thief_crate_upwarp.mkv|video]] - either link a video or see if converting from mkv -> mp4 or something will allow the vid to play without having to download) (actually, find on discord when this was discovered)

The green gummy jump up to the [[Clockwork Gobbo]] [[Pasted image 20240623214912.png|here]] can be skipped by:
- doing a [[Cage Skip]]
- using a blue gummy jump

The [[Clockwork Gobbo]] has a [[Heart Pot]] at the end (I believe this is the only level with a heart pot..? apart from the simon says game in sailor hub)
