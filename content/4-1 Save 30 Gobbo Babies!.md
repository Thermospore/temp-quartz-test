(omg and [wall climbing](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/740715478548348929))

You get 2 [[Crystal]]s from returning a baby to a cage, but if it's crying (from being dropped on the ground) you get 0 crystals.

You can stop a baby from crying by throwing it down the slide. You don't have to throw it all the way from the top; even throwing it at the very bottom edge of the slide works too (discovered [2020-01-21](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/669094088036974622) by [[Thermospore]])!

If you accidentally bring a baby into the [[Golden Gobbo]] area, you will have to temporarily set it down (making it cry) to hit the switch ([source](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1283772746886676583)). (what would happen if you left the baby in the golden gobbo area??)

(also note the strat where if you accidentally throw in a crying baby and lose crystals, you can [[Death Abuse|DA]] after returning all 30 babies just to grab the crystals! [[limbus|limbus]] did it in their [[Max%]] run for MMR4 on 2024-09-15 ([link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250758415?t=03h29m17s)))

[[Pasted image 20240621195716.png|This]] corner section by the slide is very buggy. Weird things can happen when you jump into it:
- [[upwarp]] onto the slide / stairs
- [[OoB]] and fall to your death
- oob and land on the [[Clockwork Gobbo]] section behind the wall

You can stomp on these pots, allowing you to do unintended things. For example, skipping this comically buggy ladder
