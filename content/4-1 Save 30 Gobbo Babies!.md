You get 2 [[Crystal]]s from returning a baby to a cage, but if it's crying (from being dropped on the ground) you get 0 crystals.

You can stop a baby from crying by throwing it down the slide. You don't have to throw it all the way from the top; even throwing it at the very bottom edge of the slide works too! ([video](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1253558811092979743))

[[Pasted image 20240621195716.png|This]] corner section by the slide is very buggy. Weird things can happen when you jump into it:
- [[upwarp]] onto the slide / stairs
- oob and fall to your death
- oob and land on the [[Clockwork Gobbo]] section behind the wall

You can stomp on these pots, allowing you to do unintended things. For example, skipping this comically buggy ladder
