They have a (unintended) practical use: [[Cutscene Break]]

Fun fact: you can use them while bouncing on a [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]] if you use them on the frame you hit the gummi ([[binos_on_gummi.mp4|video]]). probably in the same vein as [[Hazard Jump]]

It is possible to hold more than one pair (found [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/675795608048762890) by [[Thermospore|thermo]]):
- open the zoomies box in [[Sailor Village]]
- add a pair with the Cheat Menu
- grab the actual pair
- you now have two pairs (there doesn't seem to be any effect though)
