You can use the [[Clockwork Gobbo|Robo Gobbo]] from the bridge, without having to jump down and take the [[Balloon]] back up ([[crow_balloonlessRG.mp4|video]]; discovered by [[Thermospore]] 2024-10-19)
- [[Paulmall]] quickly discovered a setup: you can just do a ledge grab and use the [[Clockwork Gobbo]] as you pull yourself up ([video](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1297102335843242006))
- Switching to [[Controller Options#Type 2|Type 2]] can make it easier to get a ledge grab (but loses time, of course)
- [[Pasted image 20241019165007.png|This]] screenshot from [[limbus]] (presumably orthographic and from Blender) shows the valid range where the bridge doesn't block the Clockwork Marker

In the final room, you can do a [[Gummi Buffer]] into the [[Golden Gobbo]] section, allowing you to skip up onto the platforms. < check which type of [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] is the fastest >. Discovered by [[Paulmall]] [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/864121426369708032) on 2021-07-12

The green [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]] up to [[Pasted image 20240930194216.png|this]] [[Crystal]] box in the final room can be skipped by:
- doing a [[Cage Skip]]
- using a blue gummi jump
- using a orange jelly (proven [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1292035291338637373) on [[PS1#JP]])
- (btw, this same skip can be done in [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Theif]])

The direction is held on kb/dpad for that number of gobbo bounces. Seems to match what I do in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/m7ploo5m) 100% sailor IW from 2019-02-25

wait, I seem to be doing something more advanced in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/z57ne2dm) Max% IL from 2020-02-15 (jfc I was not in a good mood lol)

and in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPORc0VfhOY&t=460s) [[100%]] run from 2020-08-13 there are some differences too. I might have been doing safe strats; it's possible I knew about faster strats

- [ ] do some actual crow runs to get my head back in the game
- [ ] search discord for info/history
- [ ] could be some additional runs worth checking for strats
