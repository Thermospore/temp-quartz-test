The [[Monkey Bars]] in this level are possibly cursed (see [[Monkey Bars#Randomly dropping off]])

In the final room, you can do a [[Gummi Buffer]] into the [[Golden Gobbo]] section, allowing you to skip up onto the platforms. (check which type of [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] is the fastest).

The direction is held on kb/dpad for that number of gobbo bounces. Seems to match what I do in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/m7ploo5m) 100% sailor IW from 2019-02-25

wait, I seem to be doing something more advanced in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/z57ne2dm) Max% IL from 2020-02-15 (jfc I was not in a good mood lol)

and in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPORc0VfhOY&t=460s) [[100%]] run from 2020-08-13 there are some differences too. I might have been doing safe strats; it's possible I knew about faster strats

- [ ] do some actual crow runs to get my head back in the game
- [ ] search discord for info/history
- [ ] could be some additional runs worth checking for strats
