In the final room, you can do a [[Gummi Buffer]] into the [[Golden Gobbo]] section, allowing you to skip up onto the platforms. (check which type of [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] is the fastest). Discovered by [[Paulmall]] [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/864121426369708032) on 2021-07-12
# Blind gems mess
[[Thermospore]]'s notes for blind [[Color Crystal|Gem]]s for [[100%]]:

> 1: RIGHT - 6
> 2: DOWN - 5.5
> 3: UP/LEFT â†’ UP on 5
> 4: DOWN - jump @4.5 let go @6
> 5: LEFT - 6

The direction is held on kb/dpad for that number of gobbo bounces. Seems to match what I do in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/m7ploo5m) 100% sailor IW from 2019-02-25

wait, I seem to be doing something more advanced in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/z57ne2dm) Max% IL from 2020-02-15 (jfc I was not in a good mood lol)

and in [this](https://www.speedrun.com/croc_2/runs/z05g23em) [[100%]] run from 2020-08-13 there are some differences too. I might have been doing safe strats; it's possible I knew about faster strats

- [ ] do some actual crow runs to get my head back in the game
- [ ] search discord for info
- [ ] could be some additional runs worth checking for strats
