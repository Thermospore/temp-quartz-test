< what happens to your Keys if you die? >

You are able to hold multiple Keys simultaneously. For example in [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]], if you give yourself 1 with the Cheat Menu (see: [[Cheats]]), then pick up the 3 in the level, you will have 4 total (screenshots: [[Pasted image 20240912101312.png|Backpack]], [[Pasted image 20240912101551.png|Cheat Menu]])

In the Cheat Menu you can not increase your Key count past 1. But if you already have more than 1 key, it will let you decrease your Key count haha.

It also seems that you can't bring keys in or out of a level; your key count gets reset to 0

[[Infinite Item Glitch]] also doesn't seem to work for keys
