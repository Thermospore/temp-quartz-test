- [Here](https://www.twitch.tv/thecrypticjacknife) is their Twitch account (thecrypticjacknife)
- [This](http://www.twitch.tv/crypticjacknife/new) Twitch account (crypticjacknife) is also linked in the description of [this](https://youtu.be/SLubuOP7oUY?si=3w4D7fnyqRzTx94v) YouTube video from 2011-02-02. The link no longer seems to work; perhaps there is a typo in the URL, the account is no longer active, or the account was renamed to *the*crypticjacknife
