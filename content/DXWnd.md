- see: [[Display Options#Windowing]]

a lot of ppl use it to play windowed (but [[Thermospore]] stopped using it cos of framerate issues; see [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/dxwnd/discussion/general/thread/e9e75ac2/) forum post)

it's pretty sick tho you can mess with the graphics, like [wireframe mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3tdIUEKoS0)

Unfortunately, believe it or not, the resolutions available in the [[Display Options]] menu in-game are hardcoded on DxWnd's end. [[hdc0]] presents a few ways to add custom resolutions [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/420089939284328448)
