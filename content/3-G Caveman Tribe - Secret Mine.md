You can clip in without spending any [[Golden Gobbo]]s (see: [[Jiggy Clip]])

There is a Crystal on the [[Minecart]] tracks right near the start which can be tricky to grab without dying. There are a couple strategies:
- Hold keyboard left THEN right at the same time [like so](https://www.twitch.tv/bsg_marathon/clip/ExquisiteBlindingAppleDancingBanana-aTuitCgkObWOxaNn)
	- see: [[Minecart#Holding left + right simultaneously]]
	- (note: in the clip, [[Thermospore|thermo]]'s dpad is mapped to kb arrow keys. and right arrow is held on the physical kb, so the right press isn't visible on the controller input display)
- Let off left temporarily [like so](https://www.twitch.tv/bsg_marathon/clip/FrailPopularRadicchioKAPOW-OADmgW_VjYMWS48q)

The [[Pasted image 20240915130732.png|first junction]] is a trick; it appears to take you right by default, but it actually defaults straight. (I believe that is the only trick junction?)

If you are terrible at games, like [[Thermospore]], and have trouble with the jump timing for those [[Crystal]]s right after the trick junction, try [[Pasted image 20240923222214.png|this setup]]

There is a tricky string of [[Crystal]]s at the end, but it's actually deceptively simple. Just stay flat before / after this section:
1. hold left - over the [[Pasted image 20240923222810.png|broken track]]
1. go flat - for [[Pasted image 20240923223221.png|this crystal]] just after the broken track
1. hold left - for [[Pasted image 20240923223326.png|the crystal after that]]
