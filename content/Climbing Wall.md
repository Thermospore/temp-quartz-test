check if ladders (ex in [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower!|Pet]] or [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]]) are internally the same as climbing walls or not

Annoyingly, you can't grab onto a climbing wall during a stomp jump (check the proper name for that type of jump). But you can grab on during a normal jump or even a [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]].

Most interestingly, when grabbing on from a gummi jump, it's actually a [[Gummi Buffer]] and you do an additional gummy jump when you get to the top of the wall or when jumping off early.
