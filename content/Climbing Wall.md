< check if ladders (ex in [[3-4 Climb the Devil's Tower!|Pet]] or [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]]) are internally the same as climbing walls or not >

You can randomly fall off Climbing Walls (as well as with [[Monkey Bars]] and [[Rope]]s). [Here](https://youtu.be/yyamyD8hZ7s?si=gjipSAkzaNJ4sOrD&t=5900) is an example of [[Paulmall]] falling off one at the start of [[4-2 Up The Waterfall|Waterfall]]. Some are particularly notorious for this, such as the one at the end of [[3-4 climb the devil's tower!|pet]] and the ladder in [[4-1 Save 30 Gobbo Babies!|Babies]] (assuming those are Climbing Wall haha)

Annoyingly, you can't grab onto a climbing wall during a stomp jump (check the proper name for that type of jump). But you can grab on during a normal jump or even a [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]].

Most interestingly, when grabbing on from a gummi jump, it's actually a [[Gummi Buffer]] and you do an additional gummy jump when you get to the top of the wall or when jumping off early.
