The timing is a little tricky, but at the start of the right side you can do lil [[Minecart]] hops [[chests_lilspeedhops.mp4|like so]] to maintain your speed
- actually, you don't even have to *hold* left/right like in the vid, even just a tap is good enough to grab the left/right crystals
- (does it even make a difference due to elevator cycle?? when does the elevator cycle start?)

No practical use, but you *can* front flip up [[Pasted image 20240627203846.png|this]] wall (find video evidence)

When do the cycles for [[Pasted image 20240626212046.png|these]] elevator things start again? on level entry or within a certain range? implications for making [[Pasted image 20240626212515.png|this]] cycle?

([[Thermospore|thermo]] note: I vaguely recall front flipping up [[Pasted image 20240626211758.png|this]] wall at some point...)

[[Pasted image 20240709193812.png|Here]] at the end of the right side, you can do a purple [[Gummi Buffer]] into the [[Golden Gobbo]] warp (any categories where this saves time?)

On the right side after grabbing the yellow [[Color Crystal|Gem]] (for [[100%]] / [[Max%]]), you can quickly [[Death Abuse|DA]] back to the entrance by bouncing under the bridge ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veTZwTu4wj0&t=79)). [[Paulmall]] timed this to be about 1 second faster than taking the [[Minecart]] back ([source](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/602070812693889037)). It could potentially save even more time if you use a purple [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]] (horizontal speed boost)

< document / investigate this middle path [[Minecart]] [[Crystal]]s stuff >
- backtrack instead of [[Death Abuse|DA]] seems faster ([link](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1287289751467987014))

The green [[Color Crystal|Gem]] on [[PS1]] is harder to collect than on [[PC]]; it is behind a tight turn like the purple [[Color Crystal|Gem]] ([video](https://youtu.be/wJ1YUwekFSs&t=263))

< is there a one-and-done strat for [[Pasted image 20241006215824.png|this]] [[Minecart]] section??? >
# Minecart Crystal jankiness
The [[Crystal]]s on the [[Minecart]] tracks are notoriously difficult to grab, and some sections seem to require multiple trips. [[limbus]] suspects the developers placed the Crystals before the Minecart jumping mechanic was even fully developed, and they never got around to fully finishing the mechanic. Apparently in an April 1999 build of the game the Minecart jumping mechanic was entirely unfinished, yet the Crystals had already been placed.
