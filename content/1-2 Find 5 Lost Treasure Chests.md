When do the cycles for [[Pasted image 20240626212046.png|these]] elevator things start again? on level entry or within a certain range? implications for making [[Pasted image 20240626212515.png|this]] cycle?

([[Thermospore|thermo]] note: I vaguely recall front flipping up [[Pasted image 20240626211758.png|this]] wall at some point...)

wait... on the right side for [[Max%]] is it faster to [[Death Abuse|DA]] back to the entrance or take the [[Minecart]]?
