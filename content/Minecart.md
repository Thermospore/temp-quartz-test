jumping ACTUALLY makes you go faster on minecarts. might only apply when you are going uphill.

When controlling a minecart, keyboard input fully overrides analog stick input.

oooo [[rubbishbinman]] found something weird [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1279769934536249380). update this once we figure it out

I vaguely recall [[Aroymart]] finding a variety of weird minecart stuff. for example:

# Holding left + right simultaneously
For some reason when leaning left using the keyboard, if you hold right simultaneously you will tilt a little to the right. This can be used for collecting a [[Crystal]] near the start of [[3-G Caveman Tribe - Secret Mine|Caveman Jigsaw]] without dying. Unfortunately, you can not do it by holding two analog sticks in opposite directions or by combining analog and kb input.
