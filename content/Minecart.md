jumping ACTUALLY makes you go faster on minecarts. might only apply when you are going uphill.

When controlling a minecart, keyboard input fully overrides analog stick input.

In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Zifh8ZPfk#t=6m15s) video, [[Dr Revert]] manages to do a glitch that makes the minecart doors open even when Croc walks up to them without being on a minecart. This is in the demo WAD for [[1-2 Find 5 Lost Treasure Chests|Chests]], which is why the side paths are missing. Perhaps this can be done in standard levels as well?? Excerpt from the video description:

> At the end of first gameplay I wanted to execute a glitch I managed to activate later, to freely open gates without using the cart. However the camera got stuck for some reason.

oooo [[limbus]] found something weird [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1279769934536249380) (update this once we figure it out). in the same vein, he also got [this](https://youtu.be/JLR4RQwyErE?si=iJ_i1C9CyPnp3jaS&t=533) wackiness. Could potentially use it to [[Death Abuse|DA]]!

I vaguely recall [[Aroymart]] finding a variety of weird minecart stuff. for example:

# Holding left + right simultaneously
For some reason when leaning left using the keyboard, if you hold right simultaneously you will tilt a little to the right. This can be used for collecting a [[Crystal]] near the start of [[3-G Caveman Tribe - Secret Mine|Caveman Jigsaw]] without dying. Unfortunately, you can not do it by holding two analog sticks in opposite directions or by combining analog and kb input.
