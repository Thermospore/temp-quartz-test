For some reason on [[PC]], quads seem to be triangulated in the opposite direction from [[PS1]]. This appears to be the reason why things such as [[Cage Skip]], [[Upwarp]]s, [[Pasted image 20240930123736.png|this]] ledge in [[Cossack Village]], etc work differently between PS1 and PC (discovered by [[limbus]] [2024-09-30](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290108572511764584))

(add some in-game example images; there are some around [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1290108572511764584) from [[limbus]])
