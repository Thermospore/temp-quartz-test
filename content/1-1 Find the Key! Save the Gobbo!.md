Right at the start you can do a [[Cage Skip]] (the skip is named after this level, but can be used elsewhere), allowing you to skip almost the entire level in [[Any%]]

You can oob [[Pasted image 20240625223031.png|here]] [like so](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/478417669163450378), fwiw (is this geometry elsewhere? could come in handy for a [[Death Abuse|DA]])

You are able to jump the gap around [[Pasted image 20240625221042.png|this]] tree (like in [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Thief]]), but in [[Max%]] there is a [[Crystal]] box you need to grab on the other side.

You can skip the [[Rope]] in the [[Golden Gobbo]] room with a front flip ([[cage_gg_ff.mkv|video]])
