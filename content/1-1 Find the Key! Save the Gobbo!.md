Right at the start you can do a [[Cage Skip]] (the skip is named after this level, but can be used elsewhere), allowing you to skip almost the entire level in [[Any%]]

You can do a front flip [here](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/1296080584531247124) to maintain momentum through the dialogue (verify if this actually saves time, and where else it can be applied)

When grabbing the green [[Color Crystal|Gem]] and [[Death Abuse|DA]]ing back to the [[Save Gong]], you have two options:
1. grab the heart during the fade-out
	- slow, but easy and you get a heart
	- [video](https://youtu.be/-z2ObWAXL4I?si=Tqr00MQa5jbSTtaP&t=53)
2. grab the green gem during the fade-out
	- fast, but you don't get a heart and you risk missing the gem

You can [[OoB]] [[Pasted image 20240625223031.png|here]] [like so](https://discord.com/channels/313375426112389123/408694062862958592/478417669163450378), fwiw (is this geometry elsewhere? could come in handy for a [[Death Abuse|DA]])

You are able to jump the gap around [[Pasted image 20240625221042.png|this]] tree (like in [[1-5 Save the Bird from the Thief|Thief]]), but in [[Max%]] there is a [[Crystal]] box you need to grab on the other side.

[This](https://youtu.be/xt_IkErjFek?si=7Rud87vsDPN-ngWI&t=317) seems like a pretty good strat for the blue [[Color Crystal|Gem]] (wait maybe you can just front flip straight onto the box, maybe that's faster?)

You can skip the [[Rope]] in the [[Golden Gobbo]] room with a front flip ([[cage_gg_ff.mp4|video]])

You can [[Gummi Buffer]] out the final [[Door]] with a purple [[Jelly Jump|Gummi Jump]], but it is a little tricky; kinda like threading a needle. There is a bit of a setup, though: walk straight off the edge (facing towards where the blue [[Color Crystal|Gem]] was), bounce off the right side of the [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]], then just hold straight towards the right side of the door ([like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T37o_0degGA&t=142s))

(rework this paragraph now that you added the one above) In [[Max%]], when returning to the cage after grabbing the [[Golden Gobbo]] in the final cave: you can use a purple [[Jelly Jump|Gummi]], which gives a massive horizontal speed boost, and [[Gummi Buffer]] out the door. Perhaps gummi buffering into the golden gobbo room could save time as well??
