# To-do
## Explorer panel doesn't show up when window is too narrow
applies to both desktop and mobile

## add a panel / page that lists recently updated / added notes
I'd be surprised if there isn't a way
## ^[this thing]
I like citing sources with this wikipedia-style thing^[url goes here] cos it's very fast and easy. but it seems to not work on quartz. gotta either fix that or find a different way to cite. (there are some citations in [[Hella Skip]], to test)
## media folder
we had better get images n stuff into a folder (like `quartz/content/media` or something), or this is gonna become a mess real fast

probably gotta fiddle around with quartz (and obsidian) settings. [this](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/CrawlLinks) might be a lead
## theme
right now the site just has the default quartz theme lol
## can't search by alias...

## aliases aren't shown at the top of the page?

## graph doesn't appear to show a node for articles that don't exist?
low priority

(btw the pages exist now, so the graph will be populated if you look at it now)
