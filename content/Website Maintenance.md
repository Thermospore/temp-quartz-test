## Explorer panel doesn't show up in mobile view
(BTW even on desktop the mobile view is used when the window is narrow)

ok this can probably be changed in [the layout](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/layout)

ok I replaced the graph on mobile with the explorer, but it looks terrible lol:

maybe would be nice if it could be under one of those burger things ä¸‰ and pop out of the side, maybe
## add a panel / page that lists recently updated / added notes
see [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/recent-notes)

uhhh ok I tried adding the component but it doesn't actually show recent notes lol

I guess we could simply link to the github commit history page or something?
## ^[this thing]
I like citing sources with this wikipedia-style thing^[url goes here] cos it's very fast and easy. but it seems to not work on quartz. gotta either fix that or find a different way to cite. (there are some citations in [[Hella Skip]], to test)
## media folder
we had better get images n stuff into a folder (like `quartz/content/media` or something), or this is gonna [[Pasted image 20240626223540.png|become a mess]] real fast

probably gotta fiddle around with quartz (and obsidian) settings. [this](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/CrawlLinks) might be a lead
## theme
right now the site just has the default quartz theme lol
## can't search by alias...

## should we merge these pull requests or no?
might have to ask about this on the quartz discord

## aliases aren't shown at the top of the page?

## graph doesn't appear to show a node for articles that don't exist?
low priority

(btw the pages exist now, so the graph will be populated if you look at it now)
